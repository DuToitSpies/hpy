/* The Debug context is a wrapper around an underlying context, which we will
   call Universal. Inside the debug mode we manipulate handles which belongs
   to both contexts, so to make things easier we create two typedefs to make
   it clear what kind of handle we expect: UHPy and DHPy:

     * UHPy are opaque from our point of view.

     * DHPy are actually DebugHandle* in disguise. DebugHandles are wrappers
       around a UHPy, with a bunch of extra info.

   To cast between DHPy and DebugHandle*, use as_DebugHandle and as_DHPy:
   these are just no-op casts.

   To wrap a UHPy, call DHPy_wrap: this contains some actual logic, because it
   malloc()s a new DebugHandle, which will be released at some point in the
   future after we call HPy_Close on it.  Note that if you call DHPy_wrap
   twice on the same UHPy, you get two different DHPy.

   To unwrap a DHPy and get the underyling UHPy, call DHPy_unwrap. If you call
   DHPy_unwrap multiple times on the same DHPy, you always get the same UHPy.

   WARNING: both UHPy and DHPy are alias of HPy, so we need to take care of
   not mixing them, because the compiler cannot help.

   Each DebugHandle has a "generation", which is just a int to be able to get
   only the handles which were created after a certain point.

/* Under CPython:
     - UHPy always end with 1 (see hpy.universal's _py2h and _h2py)
     - DHPy are pointers, so they always end with 0

   DHPy_sanity_check is a minimal check to ensure that we are not treating a
   UHPy as a DHPy. Note that DHPy_sanity_check works fine also on HPy_NULL.

   NOTE: UHPy_sanity_check works ONLY with CPython's hpy.universal. If you
   bundle the debug mode in an alternative Python implementation, you should
   probably change/override UHPy_sanity_check, possibly with an #ifdef.
