/* We define HPy_New as a macro around _HPy_New to suppress a
   warning. Usually, we expected it to be called this way:
       PointObject *p;
       HPy h = HPy_New(ctx, cls, &p);

   If we call _HPy_New directly, we get a warning because we are implicitly
   casting a PointObject** into a void**.  The following macro uses a trick to
   implicitly cast to void** in a safer way: the 3rd argument is passed as:

       (void)sizeof(**data), (void**)data

   The left operand of the comma operator is ignored, but the call to sizeof()
   ensures that data is a pointer to a pointer. The cast to (void) is needed
   to convince GCC not to emit a warning about the unused result.

   The goal of the comment inside the macro is to be displayed in case of
   error. If you pass a non compatible type (e.g. a PointObject* instead of a
   PointObject**), GCC will complain with an error like this:

     ...macros.h:28:19: error: invalid type argument of unary ‘*’ (...)
     ((void)sizeof(**data), / * ERROR: expected a variable of type T** * /

    (cls),                                                                    \
